		 * IP Intelligence specific evidence class containing evidence to be

		 * This wraps a dynamically generated C evidence structure.

		 * The class extends the EvidenceBase class to implement the

		 *
		 * ## Usage Example
		 *
		 * ```
		 * using namespace FiftyoneDegrees::IpIntelligence;
		 * EngineIpi *engine;
		 *
		 * // Construct a new evidence instance
		 * EvidenceIpi *evidence = new EvidenceIpi();
		 *
		 * // Add an item of evidence
		 * evidence->operator[]("evidence key") = "evidence value";
		 *
		 * // Give the evidence to an engine for processing
		 * ResultsIpi *results = engine->process(evidence);
		 *
		 * // Do something with the results (and delete them once finished)
		 * // ...
		 *
		 * // Delete the evidence
		 * delete evidence;
