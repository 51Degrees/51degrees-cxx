		 * A group of items accessible by index or key.
		 *
		 * A Collection instance hands out new instances of any item requested
		 * so once they are finished with, they must be deleted. A static
		 * object is not returned, as this would require any type V to declare
		 * a default constructor in the case that the caller declares a
		 * variable before calling a get method.
		 *
		 * ## Usage Example
		 *
		 * ```
		 * FiftyoneDegrees::Common::Collection<string, string> *collection;
		 *
		 * // Iterate over all indexes
		 * for (int i = 0; i < collection->getSize(); i++) {
		 *
		 *     // Get the value for the current index
		 *     string *value = collection->getByIndex(i);
		 *
		 *     // Do something with the value
		 *     // ...
		 *
		 *     // Delete the value instance
		 *     delete value;
		 * }
		 *
		 * // Or get a value using it's key of type <T>
		 * string *value = collection->getByKey("string type key");
		 *
		 * // Do something with the value
		 * // ...
		 *
		 * // Delete the value instance
		 * delete value;
		 * ```
		 *
		 * @tparam K key type for the items in the collection which must be
		 * unique e.g. string is used for property meta data where the unique
		 * key is the name of the property. The type K must implement the '<'
		 * and '==' operators
		 * @tparam V value type for the items stored in the collection. These
		 * must be instantiatable by the collection, and should implement a
		 * public destructor as their lifetimes are not handled by the
		 * collection instance
